Better document the code

Add simpler examples of field of coefficients in the first computations

Improve GUI to allow for in-window parameter selection.

Import final data as PyTorch for neural network training?

Open small window explaining each of the "computations" when mouse hover over the button selection.

There is juts so much things to do, I dont have enough time...

field of coeff on heart data

Apply that to multivariate times series (construct embedding out of n times series instead of just one and uncover topological structures that relates
a collection of times series.)

add the time delay computation to demonstrate how TDA can help us to understand muilti-scale data. cf. my Bochum presentation.

Possible application of this method: Multivariate time series and symbolic regression. GW from anomalous pulsar data. Explore more the "field of coefficient" part.
